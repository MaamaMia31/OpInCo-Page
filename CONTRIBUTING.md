## How to Contribute - Installation Guide

Before getting started let's install the project on your system!!

### 1. ðŸ”¨ Setup & Run

Visit our GitHub repository and click on the **Fork** option in the top right corner of your GitHub account.
This creates a copy of the repository.


### 2. Clone the repository
**git clone** command creates a copy/clone of the repository in you local system.

--> You can clone this repo by using the below command and navigate to the directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/OpInCo-Page.git
cd OpInCo-Page
```

### 3. Setup Remote

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/OpInCo-Page/OpInCo-Page.git
```

### 4. Sync your fork or your local repository with the origin repository


  ```bash
  git checkout main
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main
  ```

### 5. Set-up the requisite Tech Stack.

**Intro** : This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

To Get Started. First, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
    OR
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.
The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

#### <u>Learn More</u>

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

#### <u>Deploy on Vercel</u>

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
